   Users record their screen (and optionally their webcam) via the Electron desktop app. The recorded video is then uploaded to the express server.

2. **Processing:**\
   The express server processes the video‚Äîextracting audio, uploading the video to AWS S3, and generating AI transcriptions and summaries.

3. **AI Integration:**\
   OpenAI Whisper converts audio to text, and GPT-3.5-turbo creates a title and summary based on the transcription.

4. **User Interaction:**\
   Processed video details, including AI-generated transcriptions, summaries, view counts, and an activity feed, are displayed in a responsive, intuitive interface.
